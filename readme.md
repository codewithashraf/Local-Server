# ⚡ Start Server Installer (Live Server Alternative)

A powerful and lightweight local server CLI tool — just like VS Code Live Server, but without the extension!

This tool allows you to serve **any directory** as a live-reloading web server on `http://localhost:5000`. No need to install Node.js globally — just download the installer and run from the terminal.
