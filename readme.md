It works completely **independently** — no extensions or code editors required.

- ✅ Simple to use — just run `start-server` from any folder

- 🧠 **Smart index detection** – serves `index.html` if available, otherwise shows folder listing
- 🗂️ Directory listing with file icons, size, and modified time
- ❌ 404-safe handling (e.g. favicon error handling)
